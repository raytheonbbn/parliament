Provides classes and interfaces for defining indexes that can be
accessed via SPARQL queries. There are three types of indexes:
<ul>
	<li>{@link com.bbn.parliament.jena.graph.index.QueryableIndex} - An index that is meant for querying</li>
	<li>{@link com.bbn.parliament.jena.graph.index.RangeIndex} - An index that is meant for range queries</li>
	<li>{@link com.bbn.parliament.jena.graph.index.CompositeIndex} - An index that is made up of other indexes</li>
</ul>
Access to the indexes in SPARQL queries is handled through property
functions that access the index directly, or through an {@link
com.bbn.parliament.jena.query.index.IndexPatternQuerier} which accesses
the index to solve portions of a query that it has claimed
responsibility for.
