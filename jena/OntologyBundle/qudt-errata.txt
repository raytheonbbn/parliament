QUDT errata (submitted):
- Unnecessary equivalentClass
- Orphaned property restrictions (bottom of qudt-datatype.ttl)
- Property restriction that has no constraint (owl:onProperty qudt:mySQLName, in qudt.ttl)
- Some sh:PropertyShape objects are not explicitly typed as such (see the one that has a sh:qualifiedValueShape property in qudt-datatype.ttl)
