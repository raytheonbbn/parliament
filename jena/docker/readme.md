# Parliament Docker

 
#### Building
##### Windows
If you have already built parliament in a Windows OS just call ant:

    ant
Otherwise specify the url to the Parliament RedHat build first in the variable "parl_url" and the version in the variable "parl_version" (Note: for the above, make sure the neither the parl_url nor the parl_version variables are set!).  E.g., 

    set parl_url=https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament/releases/download/release-2.7.13/Parliament-v2.7.13-msvc-64.zip
    set parl_version=2.7.13
    ant build-win

If "https_proxy" has been set as an environment variable, the ant script will use the proxy for building (only).  Also note when building on a Windows OS, you will need to make sure your Docker Desktop has been switched to using Windows Containers (right click Docker app icon in task bar, click "Switch to Windows Containers..." if not already in that mode). For the linux builds below Docker Desktop will needs to be switched to using Linux Containers.  

##### RHEL8
If you have already built parliament in a RedHat 8 OS just call ant:

    ant
Otherwise specify the url to the Parliament RedHat build first in the variable "parl_url" (Note: for the above, make sure the parl_url is not set!) and the version in the variable "parl_version". E.g.,

    export parl_url=https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament/releases/download/release-2.7.13/Parliament-v2.7.13-gcc-centos7-64.zip
    export parl_version=2.7.13
    ant build-rhel8

##### Ubuntu   
Specify the url to the Parliament RedHat build first in the variable "parl_url" and the version in the variable "parl_version". E.g., 

    export parl_url=https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament/releases/download/release-2.7.13/Parliament-v2.7.13-gcc-ubuntu18-64.zip
    export parl_version=2.7.13
    ant build-ubuntu

##### Building with the Dockerfiles only
If you only want to build an image without using the full parliament distribution, this can be done on the command line by setting environemnt variables and calling Docker directly. E.g., to build a RHEL8 container with a Parliament image on a windows machine, just set the variable parl_url as above, and call docker:

    set parl_url=https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament/releases/download/release-2.7.13/Parliament-v2.7.13-gcc-centos7-64.zip
    docker build -t parliament-rhel8-2.7.13 -f Dockerfile-rhel8 --build-arg parl_url .

Optionally if you are behind a firewall and need a proxy, you can set the https_proxy variable and pass it in:

     set https_proxy=http://your.proxy.com:80
     set parl_url=https://github.com/SemWebCentral/parliament/releases/download/release-2.7.13/Parliament-v2.7.13-gcc-centos7-64.zip
     docker build -t parliament-rhel8-2.7.13 -f Dockerfile-rhel8 --build-arg https_proxy --build-arg parl_url .  

   
## Load Parliament Image
You can load the factory built images by downloading one of the docker image *-docker.tar.gz files from github, or if you built a new container, it will be found in target/distro directory.  Load locally using:

    docker load -i parliament-rhel8-2.7.13.tar.gz

Verify it was loaded with:

    docker image ls

## Running Parliament

Parliament publishes to port 8089 in the container. You will need to map a local port you need to run it on using the run command.  E.g., to run it locally on port 80 you would use the following:

    docker run --name parliament -dip 80:8089 parliament-rhel8-2.7.13

You can (should) also run it with a local directory used for persistent storage (this is recommended). Create your directory and map it as follows:

    mkdir -p C:\data\kb-data
    docker run --name parliament -dip 80:8089 -v C:\data\kb-data:/usr/local/Parliament/kb-data parliament-rhel8-2.7.13

or for a Windows container:

    docker run --name parliament -dip 80:8089 -v C:\data\kb-data:c:\Parliament/kb-data parliament-win-2.7.13
     
If you need to connect to running parliament container:

    docker exec -it parliament cmd.exe

To stop the running container use:  

    docker stop parliament
Note: if you have not set up a volume for persistent storage (mapped to "Parliament/kb-data" as above), all data will be lost if the container is removed.
