Provides classes for creating a composite numeric index. The {@link
com.bbn.parliament.jena.graph.index.numeric.composite.CompositeNumericIndex}
is a {@link com.bbn.parliament.jena.graph.index.CompositeIndex} that
indexes all numeric predicates in a graph. As statements are added to
the graph, if the object is numeric, the statement is index. If the
predicate has not been seen before with a numeric object, a new numeric
index is created for that predicate; otherwise, the statement is added
to an existing index.
