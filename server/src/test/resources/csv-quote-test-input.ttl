President Trump on Thursday backed down from his controversial push
to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, effectively conceding
defeat in a battle he had revived just last week and promised to continue
despite a recent string of legal defeats.

Trump announced that he instead plans to order every federal agency to give
records to the Commerce Department that detail the numbers of citizens and
noncitizens in the United States.

"I'm proud to be a citizen, you're proud to be a citizen," Trump said at
the late afternoon event in the White House Rose Garden. "The only people
that are not proud to be citizens are the ones who are fighting us all the
way about the word 'citizen.'"

The announcement marked the end of a 19-month push by the administration to
ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey, which opponents
decried as an effort to systematically undercount Latinos and scare
immigrant communities from participating in a survey that helps determine
congressional districts and the disbursement of some federal funds.
