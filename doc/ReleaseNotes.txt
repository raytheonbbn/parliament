Version 2.8.0:

* Introduced a clean separation between Parliament's software and data files.
  The software files may now be read-only to the account under which Parliament
  is running, and the data files are easily moved to a writable location
  suitable for mass storage, such as an alternate partition, network mount,
  NAS or SAN device.  All data files, including log files, are now stored under
  the directory given by the kbDirectoryPath setting in ParliamentKbConfig.txt
  (default is kb-data under the installation directory).

* Changed the startup scripts on Linux/UNIX to properly support systemd service
  installation.

* Changed the startup scripts on Windows to parallel the Linux/UNIX scripts,
  and converted them to PowerShell.

* Fixed an issue on UNIX/Linux platforms that prevented the Parliament daemon
  from receiving SIGTERM signals, making Parliament difficult to use in a
  Docker container.

* Made the bdbCacheSize configuration parameter in ParliamentKbConfig.txt
  global across all graphs. Previously, a cache of this size was dedicated to
  each named graph. With this change, a single cache of this size is shared by
  all graphs. This is particularly beneficial to deployments that have a large
  number of graphs.  Also, raised the default cache size from 32 MB to 256 MB.

* Reduced the volume of logging when Parliament is running in daemon mode.
  Log4j is now configured without a console logger, which means that the
  contents of the parliament.log file are not duplicated in the jsvc-log.txt
  file.  (When run at the command line, the logging configuration is unchanged,
  so you will still be able to see the log contents in real time in that case.)

* Numerous updates to bring in line with Java 11 & 15 (but still using Java 8)

* Several documentation improvements, including a new section detailing how to
  secure a Parliament instance.

* Fixed an issue in the way Ivy dependencies on SLF4J were coded.

* Removed the obsolete support for Ivy publishing to a BBN-internal Ivy
  repository.

* Updated for Apple's clang 12 compiler

* Updated to Visual Studio 2019 (14.2)

* Updated to GeoTools version 24.2

* Updated to Boost 1.76.0

* Updated to Apache Commons Daemon 1.2.4

* Updated to Jetty 9.4.36

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added handling for par:directType and par:directSubClassOf predicates to speed queries
  for most-derived types.  See the User Guide, Section 2.3.1, "Reserved Predicates", for
  more information.

* Enhanced the inference engine so that whenever the subproperty rule is on, statements
  of the form "?x a ?y" where ?y is one of the standard property classes will result in
  "?x rdfs:subPropertyOf ?x".  (The property classes are owl:AnnotationProperty,
  owl:AsymmetricProperty, owl:DatatypeProp, owl:DeprecatedProperty, owl:FuncProp,
  owl:InvFuncProp, owl:IrreflexiveProperty, owl:ObjectProp, owl:ReflexiveProperty,
  owl:SymmetricProp, owl:TransitiveProp, and rdf:Property.)

* Added a directory prefix and fixed execute permissions in the distribution zip files

* Fixed the build of the Boost libraries so that the ICU library is no longer required

* Updated a number of dependency versions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Moved Parliament from Subversion-based SemWebCentral to GitHub

* Merged into the trunk the SWRL rules engine created by Carl Andersen and Doug Reid

* Added the script 'InstallService.sh' for Linux builds.  On systemd-based Linux
  distributions (including CentOS and Ubuntu), this will install Parliament as a daemon
  (a.k.a. service).  This means that Parliament will shut down properly when the machine
  shuts down (or when the daemon controller shuts it down).  This could be extended to
  other variants of Linux and to UNIX, but this is a good start that will cover our most
  important use cases.

* Long-running queries will now time out.  Two new configuration properties in
  ParliamentKbConfig.txt, TimeoutDuration and TimeoutUnit, control this behavior.

* Added configuration settings that enable linear growth of Parliament's resource and
  statement tables.  The old behavior (geometric growth) is still available, but
  disabled by default.

* Enhanced the inference engine so that whenever the subclass rule is on, statements of
  the form "?x a rdfs:class" or "?x a owl:class" will result in "?x rdfs:subClassOf ?x".

* Refactored ParliamentConfig.txt into two configuration files, ParliamentKbConfig.txt
  and ParliamentLogConfig.txt.  The latter configures Parliament's native code logging,
  and the latter configures everything else.  (The reason: Logging is configured at
  static initialization time, but the ParliamentConfig.txt file was not specified until
  later, forcing messy initialization code.)

* Changed the default KB directory from "." (the current working directory) to "kb-data"

* Removed the old-style binary zip file from the build infrastructure and documentation,
  and renamed the "quick start" binaries to indicate their status as the new standard.
  Also added javadocs.

* Fixed a bug that increased the likelihood that an ungraceful shutdown would corrupt
  the data files

* Fixed a rule engine bug that caused a runaway recursion in rare circumstances

* Fixed a rule engine bug, in which trigger lists were updated from within a loop over
  those lists' contents

* Fixed a bug that prevented the Admin web page from showing running queries due to a
  JSON parse error

* Fixed a few bugs in the temporal index implementation and unit tests

* Updated C++ code to use Boost.FileSystem and the Win32 wide character (UTF-16) API

* Numerous updates to C++ code to modernize towards C++14

* Updated to Boost 1.69.0 and MSVC 14.1 (Visual Studio 2017, 15.9.11)



=================================================

Version 2.7.11 (7/17/2017, revision 751):

* Added logging to the native code layer.

* Changed the default settings so that the inference rules for functional and
  inverse functional properties are disabled.  This is because these rules
  result in owl:sameAs statements, which Parliament does not act upon.  These
  rules can be reenabled via the ParliamentConfig.txt configuration file.

* Deprecated the obsolete keepDupStmtIdx and stmtToIdFileName settings in the
  configuration file.  These settings are now ignored.  If the setting
  keepDupStmtIdx was turned on, then Parliament would maintain the file named by
  stmtToIdFileName.  If your configuration has keepDupStmtIdx turned on, delete
  the file named by stmtToIdFileName.  Then delete these two settings from your
  configuration file.  If your configuration has keepDupStmtIdx turned off,
  simply these two settings from your configuration file.

* Decreased the size of the Windows binary packages by including only the Microsoft
  Visual C++ redistributable installers required by each one.

* Removed the need for the JNI_HEADERS environment variable on MacOS.

* Eliminated commons-logging.jar from the distribution so that slf4j can reliably
  intercept commons logging and reroute it into the Parliament log file.

* Added support for media types to the RDFFormat enum.

* Fixed the Jetty configuration to set a temporary directory local to the server
  directory.  This ensures that Jetty does not use the system temp location, which
  causes problems on managed servers that auto-clear their tmp directory on a
  scheduled basis.  Also fixed the startup code to ensure the tmp directory exists
  before Jetty needs it.

* Fixed the native code's N-Triples export, added tests for it, and exposed it
  to the Java code via the KbGraph class.

* Fixed a RemoteModel bug, in which the deleteStatements() methods ignored the
  named graph argument.

* Fixed a bug in the startup batch files for Windows.  In particular, this bug
  caused the InstallParliamentService.bat script to fail.

* Updated to Berkeley DB Java Edition version 5.0.73.

* Updated to Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 and 2015 Update 3.

* Made numerous enhancements to the C++ code to begin the migration to C++11.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Parliament 2.7.10 change list:

* Downgraded Berkeley DB from version 6.1.19 to version 5.3.28 in order to avoid
  Oracle's sneaky switch to the draconian AGPL open source license.  This change
  is not backward compatible with prior versions of Parliament.

* Implemented equivalence of typed and plain string literals, as mandated in RDF 1.1.
  The option "normalizeTypedStringLiterals" (in the ParliamentConfig.txt file) instructs
  Parliament to convert typed string literals to plain literals, both upon insert and at
  query time.  For the sake of standards compliance, this option defaults to "yes".
  However, if you require backward compatible behavior, you will need to change this
  setting to "no".  The "yes" setting is highly recommended, both because it conforms to
  RDF 1.1 and because it delivers better performance.

* Parliament 2.7.10 includes a new implementation of the temporal index.  This should
  be considered a beta implementation.  In a future version of Parliament this will be
  fully supported (and documented).

* Fixed a bug in the check of the content type of HTTP requests sent to Parliament.

* Fixed dylib install names on Macintosh so that Parliament runs properly on El Capitan.

* Changed default port from 8080 to 8089.  This can be changed in the startup script
  via the JETTY_PORT environment variable.

* Changed default listening interface from 0.0.0.0 (meaning that Parliament is reachable
  from every network interface on the machine) to localhost (so that Parliament is
  reachable only from the machine on which it runs) to enhance the default security
  stance.  This can be changed in the startup script via the JETTY_HOST environment
  variable.

* Added support for Visual Studio 2015 (msvc-14.0)

* Updated to Boost version 1.60.0

* Updated to Jetty version 9.3.6.

* Parliament is now built with (and requires) Java 8.

* The C++ unit tests now use the static variant of the Boost.Test library.  If you are
  building Parliament yourself, be sure to rebuild the Boost libraries according to the
  instructions in the Parliament User Guide, Section 3.4, "Building the Boost Libraries".

=================================================

Version 2.7.9 (4/24/2015, revision 632) of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Fixed a build infrastructure bug that caused some jars to be placed in subdirectories
  of the war file's WEB-INF/lib directory rather than in WEB-INF/lib directly.

* Sped up the build in the case of a rebuild after a small change.

* Improved the build to handle multiple Linux distributions more gracefully.

=================================================

Version 2.7.8 (3/28/2015, revision 628) of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Upgraded Parliament to use Jetty version 9.2.10.  This in turn means that
  Parliament is now compatible with Java 8.

* Enabled control of Jetty's host and port settings from the startup scripts.

* Fixed the omission of the Microsoft redistributable libraries installer.

* Updated the versions of various third-party open source libraries used in Parliament.

=================================================

Version 2.7.7 (1/19/2015, revision 613) of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Fixed a bug that prevented proper return of SELECT query results in CSV format

* Fixed a bug in Parliament's query web page.  When set to show the results as
  HTML and the query caused an error (such as with a malformed query), the
  result was an unhelpful exception trace related to an XSLT failure.  Now
  Parliament will show the error message associated with the original error.

* Improved logging of the text of SPARQL queries and updates.  By default, Parliament
  logs only malformed queries and updates to keep logs from becoming enormous.  If you
  wish to log every query and update, uncomment the line containing "SparqlStmtLogger"
  in log4j.properties.

* Improved Parliament's support of the SPARQL protocol to handle non-form POST
  requests.  Support for SPARQL-over-HTTP is still uncompleted.

* Changed Visual Studio support to include only the latest version of the compiler
  (Visual Studio 2013, a.k.a. msvc-12), and updated the redistributable packages to
  Visual Studio 2013 Update 4.

* Updated Berkeley DB to version 6.1.19.

* Updated Boost library support to version 1.57.0.

* Added a new adapter to the LUBM benchmark that connects to a remote repository
  using only standard SPARQL.

* Added a RemoteExporter class to the client-side jar that sends a backup request
  to a Parliament server and downloads the resulting zip file.

* Other minor fixes and updates.

=================================================

Version 2.7.6 (3/24/2013, revision 584) of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Switched to the clang compiler on MacOS

* Added support for msvc-11 (Microsoft Visual Studio 2012) and msvc-12
  (Visual Studio 2013), deprecated msvc-9 (Microsoft Visual Studio 2008),
  and updated Visual Studio redistributable packages.

* Upgraded to Java 1.7

* Upgraded to Jena 2.7.4, ARQ 2.9.4, and Joseki 3.4.4

* Updated to Berkeley DB 5.3.21

* Made StartParliament.bat and InstallParliamentService.bat more reliable

* Upgraded JavaService to version 2.0.10

* Upgraded Apache Commons Daemon to version 1.0.15a, adding support for
  Java 1.7 on MacOS

* Added support for JSON-LD content type on construct and describe queries
  and on file inserts

* Fixed the namespaces used in the GeoSPARQL implementation to fully match
  the standard.  (The previous namespaces are also supported for backwards
  compatibility.)

=================================================

Version 2.7.4 (11/9/2012, revision 524) of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Implements the new GeoSPARQL standard

* Changed the outputs of the build process to produce one ready-to-go
  Parliament server for each hardware architecture and compiler

* Added support for several Boost libraries (Date_Time, Filesystem,
  Regex, System, and Thread)

* Updated to Boost 1.52.0

* Updated to Berkeley DB 5.3.15

* Updated the Redistributable Packages for Microsoft's compilers

* Linux version is now built on Ubuntu 12 and CentOS 6.3

* Enhanced Linux Daemon support (though this is not yet finished)

* Major updates to the User Guide to support all of the above

* Minor enhancements, primarily to the C++ unit tests

=================================================

Version 2.7.1 of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Added support for Ubuntu Linux 10.10

* Improved web interface

* New inference rules for RDFS domain and range, and for OWL equivalent class and property

* Upgraded to Berkeley DB 5.0.26 and Boost 1.46.1

* Updated to Jetty 6.1.25, Joseki 3.4.2, Jena 2.6.4, and ARQ 2.8.7.

* Retired support for Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 and 8.0 (Visual Studio 2003 and 2005)

* Added support for Microsoft Visual C++ 10.0 (Visual Studio 2010)

* Changed to 3-segment version number

* Numerous minor enhancements and bug fixes


=================================================

Release Notes for Parliament v2.6.9.0

This release of Parliament includes these improvements:

(1) Improved reliability at shutdown:  Long-running queries are now reliably
terminated so that Parliament may shut down gracefully.

(2) The ability to terminate a runaway query:  One benefit of the improved
query termination code is that Parliament can now terminate individual queries.
Thus the web interface of Parliament now has a page that lists the outstanding
operations and allows termination of selected queries.  This feature is also
accessible via JMX.

(3) SPARQL-compliant management of named graphs:  Parliament now supports
standard SPARQL Update statements to create and delete named graphs:

    CREATE GRAPH <uri>
    DROP GRAPH <uri>

Note that the internal structure of Parliament's file storage has changed
slightly.  Previously, the directory containing Parliament's files had a
subdirectory called "graphs".  This subdirectory is now named "master".
Parliament will rename the directory the first time it opens an older KB.
Also, backups exported from previous versions will be recognized and
properly imported into the new structure.

(4) Reduced memory usage for select queries:  Parliament will now use less
memory while processing select queries.  For select queries that do not use the
"distinct" keyword, Parliament will process query with a constant amount of
memory, no matter how many results are returned.  In the case of distinct
queries, memory consumption is higher because Parliament must maintain a hash
table of results seen so far.

(5) The Home page of the Parliament web interface now shows the JVM memory
usage statistics.

=================================================

Version 2.6.7.0 of Parliament includes the following changes:

* Updates the ARQ version from 2.8.3-RC-1 to 2.8.3.

* Fixes a Java-side memory leak in the Joseki integration code.

=================================================

The 2.6.6 release of Parliament fixes two bugs:

* Version 2.8.1 of the ARQ query processor mangled ends of lines in XML
literals in SPARQL XML results (see
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev/message/43296).  This version of
Parliament includes ARQ version 2.8.3-RC-1.

* Changes to the locking scheme in the previous version of Parliament
introduced a bug that causes deadlock.  This version corrects that issue.

=================================================

New Parliament release v2.6.5.0

Version 2.6.5.0 of Parliament has been released. This version incorporates
the following changes:

* Updated to Jena 2.6.2, ARQ 2.8.1, and Joseki 3.4.1.  As a result, Java 1.6
  is now required.

* Fixed the read/write locking in the Joseki integration so that the lock
  scope includes the whole of the request processing.

* Added tracking of in-flight queries so that they can be quickly and safely
  aborted on server shutdown.

* Added periodic asynchronous flushing of the memory mapped files to help
  avoid file corruption at shutdown.

* Fixed a bug in the way UTF-8 text was passed between the Java and C++ code
  across the JNI boundary.

* Improved the unit tests.
